### REACT SIMPLE APP by ActiveMedia

This is a sample project as we are developing our skills in React integrating an API. We are using Json Placeholder as the API.
We are using the[ **Create Reactp App**](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app " **Create Reactp App**") to start developing our app as it is easy to use.

This APP is really simple and it shows how to fetch data from a API.

You can see it in action in: http://active-labs.net/simple-react-app/

#### Instructions to Run the App

You can clone or fork this repository and then

    npm install
    npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000/ and *voil√°*! The app is now running :)

If you want to deploy a version of the app on your server you can run

    npm run build

After that, you can copy the content inside the build folder to your server and check if everything is ok.
